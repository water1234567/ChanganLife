This GPS trajectory dataset was collected from students and faculties of Northwest University in China in a period of over three months. A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude, speed and timestamp. It has 220 complete trajectories generated over 7 weeks. These trajectories were recorded by different GPS loggers, and have a variety of sampling rates. Most of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 15~20 seconds. Each trajectory lasts more than 2 minutes and was plotted on the map and users were asked to tag his/her activities. The trajectory on the map and identified 5 behaviours as the ground truth: “bike, bus, car, walk, dinning, staying at home/dorm. The labeled ground truth such as “2019-10-08 07:28:25 to 2019-10-08 07:31:34 staying at dorm”. This trajectory dataset can be used in many research fields, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition, location privacy, and location recommendation.
